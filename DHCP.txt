Dynamic host configuration protocol -->

suppose we have an internet service provider and 
he gives us a modem , now this modem has globle ip address and all devices which 
are connected to it have the same ip address for outside world,
but modem gives each connected devices a local ip address, which is 
given with the help of DHCP 


now when we request something,lets say i requested google.com from my device,
google server will see the global ip address of modem and when modem get the
response back from google server then modem will decied who was the one who 
made request them modem will redirect that response to that device. 
this is done using NAT (Network Access Translator).


now ok, its fine, now response can be received on particular device who 
made the request, but now how do we know that which application 
do we need to send the message to 
now here comes the PORTS in picture. 
modem decide to which application to send the data using ports 


WHATSAPP uses port number 5222 for messaging (which is a standard port for --EXTENSIBLE MESSAGING 
AND PRESENCE PROTOCOL--)
