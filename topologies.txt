1. LAN - local area network
        example- office,house,ethernet 

2.MAN - Metropolitan area Network   
        example- across the city network 

3.WAN- wide area network
        example- across countries -optical fibre network


Internet is collection of all these 

SoNET- synchronous area networking 
frame relay- way of connecting your local area network to wider 
area
