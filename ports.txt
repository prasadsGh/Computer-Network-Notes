port number are 16 bits
so there are 2* (1e16) port numbers are available which are nead 65000

for this port number 80 is used. 

mongodb- 27017
sql - 1433 
http- 80

provide reponse to chrome, but it does not know which tab( instance) of chrome has made the request 
so here comes in picture EPHEMERAL PORTS 
this ports assign random port numbers to instances of application so that when response is received 
it get assigned to accurate instance
