Application layer - 

- user interact with this layer - example whatapp, browser etc  on devices 


------------Protocols---------------

web protocols - 

a. TCP/IP protocol- 
        1. HTTP- hypertext transfer protocol ,defines how data is transffered like html file and all 
        2. DHCP - dynamic host control protocol,allocates ip address (local) to  devices which are
                  connected to your network.
        3. FTP - file transfer protocol, how files are transferred 
        4. SMTP - simple mail transfer protocol- to send the mail 
        5. POP3 / iMAC - to receive mail 
        6. SSH - secure shell - if you want to login to terminal of someones computer 

B. TELNET - port 23 ,termical emulation , to connect to host or user over telnet,
            it enables user to manage the devices remotely 

C. UDP- stateless connection , faster, data may be lost during communication - 
        example - video calling 




------client server architecture ---------
 
- ping domain --> to see the send and receive of data packets 

- ping time is time required for roundtrip from clint(origin) to server to origin 

- can we reduce the ping time- no because this is the best possible time we are getting because signals
are travelling with speed of light through cables and satellites etc 


-------peer to peer architecture -----------

- no dedicated server 
- very efficient for scalability 
- many computers are interconnected with each other 
- decentralised network 
- every computer acts as a server as well as computer - example - bittorrent 
-
