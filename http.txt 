Hypertext Transfer Protocol- 

its client server protocol which tells how to send (in what format) the data 
to server and also tells about how to get the response from server 

- http is application layer protocol , get methods, post methods 

- https uses TCP internally - all data is received 

-TCP is transport layer protocol 

- HTTP is stateless protocol 

- stateless means it doesn't remember anything from past event,
each message is treated as new indivisual event 
its like a conversation with someone who forget everything after each statement.
