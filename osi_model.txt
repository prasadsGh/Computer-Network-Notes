open system interconnection model--> (OSI)

it was build for standard way for communicating how two or 
more computers communicate (send and receive)

There are seven layers in OSI model-->

1. Application Layer - implemented in application/software which we use

2. Presentation Layer - applicatio layer will give data to presentation layer which is in form of characters,
                        numbers and all, presentation layer encodes the data into machine readble binary code only 
                       (from ASCII to EBCDIC), it also provides abstraction 


3. Session Layer - now encoded data is sent to the session layer,session layer helps in setting up and managing connection 
                    and enables sending and receiving of data followed by termination of session 


4. Transport layer - data which is received in from above layer is broken down into segments in this layer 
                    each segment contains the source and destination (ports) and sequence number , flow control->
                    suppose client has 40 mbps but server has 20 mbps only then there should be sync in between them.
                    error control with checksum (connection oriented -tcp, connection oriented - UDP)


5. Network Layer - transmission of data from one computer to another which is located in another network
                    function of network layer -logical addressing- it assigns senders and receivers ip address to each data packet 
                    so that it get received at right destination. load balancing is also done in this layer 

6. Datalink Layer - received the data packets form network layer , physical addressing is done , packets are called as frames 
                     and transport them 

7. Physical Layer - contain hardware(cable, modem ), convert the segments from datalink layer to the electrical signals or 
                    optical fibre signals
